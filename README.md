# Howdy Habits
When we were brainstorming ideas, we became inspired by our teammate's life as a current small business owner. We strived to improve people's lives, especially those who don't have the same resources as larger companies, but are still ambitious about their passions. Thus, we decided to create Howdy Habits.

# What is it?
Howdy Habits is a website that offers relief for mental health and stress in business owner's lives by creating a platform that's easy to manage and maintain. This website adds benefits to their lives, such as: reducing distractions, allowing businesses to focus on their craft and mental health, and reducing the load of tasks needed to operate their personal and professional lives.

Initially, we sought to cater our platform to assist others, which prompted us to turn to a business-oriented website. We built Howdy Habits using the following languages, APIs, and databases; CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Node.js, Express API, Axios API, Bootstrap, Bulma, and LoadDB.

We learned programming languages and collaboration, which were very dependent on each other. As each of us came from different programming backgrounds, learning to collaborate in a way where we can lift each other and the project up was definitely a highlight in building this website.
